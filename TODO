* the unread/other stuff makes everything much slower.  figure out how to make the initial message return 
  be sorted, use that to figure out the most recent 20 conversations; use the 20 conversations to do the query of
  other messages in the conversations we're going to show, w/o having to look up all messages in all conversations

  * do search that finds something
  * edit the search bar to contain nothing
  * cmd-w -> the mail tab isn't restored
